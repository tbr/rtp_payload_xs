<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>

<t>This document specifies a payload format for packetization of video signals encoded with JPEG XS <xref target="ISO21122-1"/> into the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) <xref target="RFC3550"/>.</t>

<t>The JPEG XS coding system offers compression and recompression of video signals with very moderate computational resources while remaining robust under multiple compression and decompression cycles as well as mixing of content sources, e.g., embedding of subtitles, overlays, or logos. Typical target compression ratios ensuring visually lossless quality are in the range of 2:1 to 18:1 depending on the nature of the source material. The latency that is introduced by the encoding-decoding process can be confined to a fraction of a video frame, typically expressed in a number of lines.</t>

<t>Initially, the first and second editions of JPEG XS only supported intra coding for video content. However, the third edition of the standard introduced the so-called Temporal Differential Coding (TDC) mode that provides a temporal decorrelation step in the wavelet domain. For progressive video content, a single frame buffer is used for the decorrelation of successive video frames. For interlaced content, two separate frame buffers are used, one for per video field.</t>

<t>This document is a necessary revision of <xref target="RFC9134"/> to incorporate support for new features introduced in the third edition of JPEG XS. Most notably, it contains the necessary provisions to support the TDC coding mode. This document obsoletes <xref target="RFC9134"/>; however, the revised payload format is designed to ensure that existing compliant implementations of <xref target="RFC9134"/> remain valid under the updated specification. Additionally, this document consolidates the errata of <xref target="RFC9134"/> and includes improvements and clarifications to its implementers and users. <xref target="annex-a"/> provides more details on the changes between <xref target="RFC9134"/> and this revision.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="media-format-description"><name>Media Format Description</name>

<t>This section explains the terminology and concepts used in this memo specific to JPEG XS as specified in <xref target="ISO21122-1"/>, <xref target="ISO21122-2"/>, and <xref target="ISO21122-3"/>.</t>

<section anchor="data-structures"><name>Data Structures</name>

<t>JPEG XS is a low-latency and lightweight coding system for compression of digital continuous-tone grayscale and color signals, like images and videos.</t>

<t>This coding system provides an efficient representation of visual content through the mathematical tool of wavelet analysis. The wavelet filter process separates each component into multiple bands, where each band consists of multiple coefficients describing the visual signal of a given component within a frequency domain specific to the wavelet filter type, i.e., the particular filter corresponding to the band.</t>

<t>Wavelet coefficients are grouped into precincts, where each precinct includes all coefficients over all bands that contribute to a spatial region of the picture.</t>

<t>One or multiple precincts are furthermore combined into slices consisting of an integer number of precincts. Precincts do not cross slice boundaries, and wavelet coefficients in precincts that are part of different slices can be decoded independently of each other. However, note that the wavelet transformation runs across slice boundaries. A slice always extends over the full width of the picture segment but may only cover parts of its height.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="sec-codestream"><name>Codestream</name>

<t>A JPEG XS codestream is formed by (in the given order):</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>a JPEG XS codestream header, which starts with a Start of Codestream (SOC) marker,</t>
  <t>one or more slices, each starting with either an SLH or SLI marker,</t>
  <t>an EOC marker to signal the end of the codestream.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The JPEG XS codestream format, including the definition of all markers, is further provided in <xref target="ISO21122-1"/>. It represents sample values of a single picture, without any interpretation relative to a color space.</t>

<t>As defined in <xref target="ISO21122-1"/>, slices are represented in the codestream as contiguous sequences of bytes, always beginning with a slice header followed by one or more precincts, and optionally including slice-based extension markers. The slice header <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be either an SLH or an SLI marker. The last byte of a slice in the codestream <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> immediately precede either an SLH or SLI marker (indicating the start of the next slice) or an EOC marker (in the case of the final slice).</t>

<t>A JPEG XS codestream not using the TDC coding mode can be decoded independently as a stand-alone picture (a video frame or field). However, a codestream that employs the TDC coding mode has a potential dependency on the contents stored in a frame buffer as described in <xref target="ISO21122-1"/>. This frame buffer holds a quantized version of all wavelet coefficients that were reconstructed from decoding the previous codestream. For progressive video streams, a single frame buffer is maintained. For interlaced video streams, two separate frame buffers are maintained, one for each video field (i.e. video fields are independent of each other).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="video-support-box-and-color-specification-box"><name>Video Support box and Color Specification box</name>

<t>While the information defined in the codestream is sufficient to reconstruct the sample values of one picture, the interpretation of the samples remains undefined by the codestream itself. This interpretation is given by the Video Support box and the Color Specification box, which contain significant information to correctly play back the JPEG XS stream. The layout and syntax of these boxes, together with their content, are defined in <xref target="ISO21122-3"/>.</t>

<t>The Video Support box provides information on the maximum bit rate, the frame rate, the interlaced mode (progressive or interlaced), the colour subsampling format, the informative timecode of the current JPEG XS frame or field, the profile, the level/sublevel used, and optionally the buffer model and the mastering display metadata.</t>

<t>Note that the profile and level/sublevel/fbblevel, specified respectively by the <spanx style="verb">Ppih</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">Plev</spanx> fields <xref target="ISO21122-2"/>, specify limits on the capabilities needed to decode the codestream and handle the output. Profiles represent a limit on the required algorithmic features and parameter ranges used in the codestream. The combination of level and sublevel defines a lower bound on the required throughput for a decoder in the visual (or decoded) domain and the codestream (or coded) domain, respectively. The frame buffer bandwidth (FBB) level defines a lower bound on the required bandwidth to read from and write to the frame buffer(s) when using the TDC coding mode. The actual defined profiles and levels/sublevels/fbblevel, along with the associated values for the <spanx style="verb">Ppih</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">Plev</spanx> fields, are defined in <xref target="ISO21122-2"/>.</t>

<t>The Color Specification box indicates the color primaries, transfer characteristics, matrix coefficients, and video full range flag needed to specify the color space of the video stream.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="jpeg-xs-frame-and-picture-segment"><name>JPEG XS frame and picture segment</name>

<t>The concatenation of a Video Support box, a Color Specification box, and a JPEG XS codestream forms a JPEG XS picture segment.</t>

<t>In the case of a progressive video stream, each JPEG XS frame consists of one single JPEG XS picture segment.</t>

<t>In the case of an interlaced video stream, each JPEG XS frame consists of two concatenated JPEG XS picture segments. Each JPEG XS picture segment corresponds exclusively to one of the two fields of the interlaced frame.</t>

<t>Note that <xref target="sec_payload_data"/> further mandates that the Video Support boxes and all of the Color Specification boxes in both picture segments of each JPEG XS frame <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> have the same respective layouts.</t>

<t>Note that the interlaced mode, as signaled by the <spanx style="verb">frat</spanx> field <xref target="ISO21122-3"/> in the Video Support box, indicates either progressive, interlaced top-field-first, or interlaced bottom-field-first mode. Thus, in the case of interlaced video, its value <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> also be identical in both picture segments.</t>

<t>Note that the <spanx style="verb">frat</spanx> field <xref target="ISO21122-3"/> in the Video Support box always signals the frame rate, even in the case of interlaced video. This should not be confused with the field rate.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="rtp-payload-format"><name>RTP Payload Format</name>

<t>This section specifies the payload format for JPEG XS streams over the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) <xref target="RFC3550"/>.</t>

<t>In order to be transported over RTP, each JPEG XS stream is transported in a distinct RTP stream, identified by a distinct synchronization source (SSRC) <xref target="RFC3550"/>.</t>

<t>A JPEG XS stream is divided into Application Data Units (ADUs), each ADU corresponding to a single JPEG XS frame.</t>

<section anchor="sec_rtp_packetization"><name>RTP Packetization</name>

<t>An ADU is made of several packetization units. If a packetization unit is bigger than the maximum size of an RTP packet payload, the unit is split into multiple RTP packet payloads, as illustrated in <xref target="fig_adu_packetization"/>. As seen there, each packet <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> contain (part of) one, and only one, packetization unit. A packetization unit may extend over multiple packets. The payload of every packet <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> have the same size (based, e.g., on the Maximum Transfer Unit of the network) with the possible exception of the last packet of a packetization unit. The boundaries of a packetization unit <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> coincide with the boundaries of the payload of a packet (excluding the payload header), i.e., the first (or, respectively, last) byte of the packetization unit <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be the first (or, respectively, last) byte of the payload (excluding its header). Note that for interlaced frames the requirements of the RTP packetization imply that each packet will only contain data corresponding to exactly one field.</t>

<t>There are two different packetization modes defined for this RTP payload format.</t>

<dl newline="true">
  <dt>Codestream packetization mode:</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>In this mode, the packetization unit <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be the entire JPEG XS picture segment (i.e., codestream preceded by boxes).  This means that a progressive frame will have a single packetization unit, while an interlaced frame will have two. The progressive case is illustrated in <xref target="fig_ex_cs_packetization"/>.</t>

  <dt>Slice packetization mode:</dt>

    <t>In this mode, the packetization unit <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be the slice, i.e., there <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be data from no more than one slice per RTP packet. The first packetization unit of each JPEG XS picture segment <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> contain the JPEG XS header segment (i.e., the concatenation of the VS box, the CS box, and the JPEG XS codestream header). This first unit is then followed by successive units, each containing one and only one slice. The packetization unit containing the last slice of a JPEG XS picture segment <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> also contain the EOC marker immediately following this last slice. This is illustrated in <xref target="fig_ex_sl_packetization"/>. In the case of an interlaced frame, the JPEG XS header segment of the second field <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be in its own packetization unit.</t>

<t>In a constant bitrate (CBR) scenario of JPEG XS, the codestream packetization mode guarantees that a JPEG XS RTP stream will produce both a constant number of bytes per video frame and a constant number of RTP packets per video frame.  However, to provide similar guarantees with JPEG XS in a variable bitrate (VBR) mode or when using the slice packetization mode (for either CBR or VBR), additional mechanisms are needed. This can involve a constraint at the rate allocation stage in the JPEG XS encoder to impose a CBR at the slice level, the usage of padding data, or the insertion of empty RTP packets (i.e., an RTP packet whose payload data is empty). But, management of the amount of produced packets per video frame depends on the application and not a strict requirement of this RTP payload specification.</t>

<t>The version (<spanx style="verb">V</spanx>), padding (<spanx style="verb">P</spanx>), extension (<spanx style="verb">X</spanx>), CSRC count (<spanx style="verb">CC</spanx>), sequence number, synchronization source (SSRC), and contributing source (CSRC) fields follow their respective definitions in <xref target="RFC3550"/>.</t>

<t>The remaining RTP header information to be set according to this RTP payload format is set as follows:</t>

<dl newline="true">
  <dt>Marker (<spanx style="verb">M</spanx>) [1 bit]:</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>If progressive video is being transmitted, the marker bit denotes the end of a video frame. If interlaced video is being transmitted, it denotes the end of a field. The marker bit <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be set to 1 for the last packet of a JPEG XS picture segment. It <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be set to 0 for all other packets.</t>
  </dd>
  <dt>Payload Type (<spanx style="verb">PT</spanx>) [7 bits]:</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>The payload type is a dynamically allocated payload type field that designates the payload as JPEG XS video.</t>
  </dd>
  <dt>Timestamp [32 bits]:</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>The RTP timestamp is set to the sampling timestamp of the content (see also <xref target="RFC3550"/> and <xref target="RFC4175"/>). A 90 kHz clock rate <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be used. If the sampling instant does not correspond to an integer value of the clock, the value <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be rounded up to the next lowest integer, with no ambiguity.
</t>

    <t>For progressive video, the timestamp denotes the sampling instant of the frame to which the RTP packet belongs. Packets <bcp14>SHALL NOT</bcp14> include data from multiple frames, and all packets belonging to the same frame <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> have the same timestamp.</t>

    <t>For interlaced video, the timestamp denotes the sampling instant of the field to which the RTP packet belongs. Packets <bcp14>SHALL NOT</bcp14> include data from multiple fields, and all packets belonging to the same field <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> have the same timestamp. Use of field timestamps, rather than a frame timestamp and field indicator bit, is needed to support reverse 3-2 pulldown.</t>

    <t>Several successive RTP packets will consequently have equal timestamps if they belong to the same video frame for progressive content, or the same video field for interlaced content. That is, the time stamp does not change until after the marker bit (<spanx style="verb">M</spanx>) is set to 1, marking the last packet of the video frame or field.  The timestamp is only increased when a new video frame or field begins.</t>

<section anchor="sec_payload_header_usage"><name>Payload Header Usage</name>

<t>The first four bytes of the payload of an RTP packet in this RTP payload format are referred to as the "payload header". <xref target="fig_payload_header"/> illustrates the structure of this payload header.</t>

<t>The payload header consists of the following fields:</t>

<dl newline="true">
  <dt>Transmission mode (<spanx style="verb">T</spanx>) [1 bit]:</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>The <spanx style="verb">T</spanx> bit is set to indicate that packets are sent sequentially by the transmitter. This information allows a receiver to dimension its input buffer(s) accordingly. If <spanx style="verb">T=0</spanx>, nothing can be assumed about the transmission order and the transmitter may send out its packets in any order. If <spanx style="verb">T=1</spanx>, the transmitter <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> send out the packets as a monotonically increasing sequence according to the F, SEP, and P fields. The <spanx style="verb">T</spanx> bit value <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be identical for all packets of the RTP stream. Note that even with <spanx style="verb">T=1</spanx>, packets may still arrive out of order relative to the sequence in which they were sent.</t>
  </dd>
  <dt>pacKetization mode (<spanx style="verb">K</spanx>) [1 bit]:</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>The <spanx style="verb">K</spanx> bit is set to indicate which packetization mode is used. <spanx style="verb">K=0</spanx> indicates codestream packetization mode, while <spanx style="verb">K=1</spanx> indicates slice packetization mode. In the case that the Transmission mode (<spanx style="verb">T</spanx>) is set to 0 (arbitrary sending order), then <spanx style="verb">K</spanx> <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be set to 1 (slice packetization mode). The <spanx style="verb">K</spanx> bit value <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be identical for all packets of the RTP stream.</t>
  </dd>
  <dt>Last (<spanx style="verb">L</spanx>) [1 bit]:</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>The <spanx style="verb">L</spanx> bit is set to indicate the last packet of a packetization unit. As the end of the video frame also ends the packet containing the last unit of the video frame, the <spanx style="verb">L</spanx> bit is set whenever the <spanx style="verb">M</spanx> bit is set. In the codestream packetization mode, the <spanx style="verb">L</spanx> bit and <spanx style="verb">M</spanx> bit get an equivalent meaning, so they <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> have identical values in each packet.</t>
  </dd>
  <dt>Interlaced information (<spanx style="verb">I</spanx>) [2 bits]:</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>These two <spanx style="verb">I</spanx> bits are used to indicate how the JPEG XS frame is scanned (progressive or interlaced). In case of an interlaced frame, they also indicate which JPEG XS picture segment the payload is part of (first or second).
</t>

    <t>00:   The payload is progressively scanned.</t>

    <t>01:   This value is reserved for future use.</t>

    <t>10:   The payload is part of the first JPEG XS picture segment of an interlaced video frame. The height specified in the included JPEG XS codestream header is half of the height of the entire displayed video frame.</t>

    <t>11:   The payload is part of the second JPEG XS picture segment of an interlaced video frame. The height specified in the included JPEG XS codestream header is half of the height of the entire displayed video frame.</t>
  </dd>
  <dt><spanx style="verb">F</spanx> counter [5 bits]:</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>The Frame (<spanx style="verb">F</spanx>) counter identifies the video frame number modulo 32 to which a packet belongs. Frame numbers <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> increment by 1 for each video frame transmitted. The frame number, in addition to the timestamp, may help the decoder manage its input buffer and bring packets back into their natural order. For interlaced frames, both fields <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> have the same <spanx style="verb">F</spanx> counter value.</t>
  </dd>
  <dt>Slice and Extended Packet (<spanx style="verb">SEP</spanx>) counter [11 bits]:</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>The <spanx style="verb">SEP</spanx> counter is used differently depending on the packetization mode.
</t>

    <t><list style="symbols">
      <t>In the case of codestream packetization mode (<spanx style="verb">K=0</spanx>), this counter resets whenever the Packet counter resets (see <xref target="sec_payload_data"/>) and increments by 1 whenever the Packet counter overruns.</t>
      <t>In the case of slice packetization mode (<spanx style="verb">K=1</spanx>), this counter identifies the slice modulo 2047 to which the packet contributes. If the data belongs to the JPEG XS header segment, this field <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> have its maximal value, namely <spanx style="verb">2047=0x07ff</spanx>. Otherwise, it is the slice index modulo 2047. Slice indices are counted from 0 (corresponding to the top of the video frame).</t>
    </list></t>
  </dd>
  <dt><spanx style="verb">P</spanx> counter [11 bits]:</dt>
  <dd>
    <t>The Packet (<spanx style="verb">P</spanx>) counter identifies the packet number modulo 2048 within the current packetization unit. It is set to 0 at the start of the packetization unit and incremented by 1 for every subsequent packet (if any) belonging to the same unit. Practically, if codestream packetization mode is enabled, this field counts the packets within a JPEG XS picture segment and is extended by the <spanx style="verb">SEP</spanx> counter when it overruns. If slice packetization mode is enabled, this field counts the packets within a slice or within the JPEG XS header segment.</t>
  </dd>

<section anchor="sec_payload_data"><name>Payload Data</name>

<t>The payload data of a JPEG XS RTP stream consists of a concatenation of multiple JPEG XS frames, each consisting of one (for progressive video) or two (for interlaced video) JPEG XS picture segments. Within the RTP stream, all of the Video Support boxes and all of the Color Specification boxes <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> retain their respective layouts for each JPEG XS picture segment across all JPEG XS frames, for the entirety of the JPEG XS RTP stream. Thus, each Video Support box in the RTP stream <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> define the same sub boxes, in the same order. The effective values in the boxes are allowed to change under the condition that their relative byte offsets <bcp14>SHALL NOT</bcp14> change. Moreover, any changed value in the boxes <bcp14>SHALL NOT</bcp14> violate other restrictions or conflict with the respective previous value.</t>

<t>Each JPEG XS frame is represented by one or more packetization unit(s), as explained in <xref target="sec_rtp_packetization"/>. <xref target="fig_cs_pack_mode_prog"/> depicts this layout for a progressive video frame in the codestream packetization mode, <xref target="fig_cs_pack_mode_int"/> depicts this layout for an interlaced video frame in the codestream packetization mode, <xref target="fig_sl_pack_mode_prog"/> depicts this layout for a progressive video frame in the slice packetization mode, and <xref target="fig_sl_pack_mode_int"/> depicts this layout for an interlaced video frame in the slice packetization mode. The Frame (<spanx style="verb">F</spanx>) counter value is not indicated because the value is constant for all packetization units of a given video frame.</t>

<section anchor="sec-traffic-shaping"><name>Traffic Shaping and Delivery Timing</name>

<t>In order to facilitate proper synchronization between senders and receivers, it is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> to implement traffic shaping and delivery timing in accordance with the Network Compatibility Model compliance definitions specified in <xref target="SMPTE2110-21"/>. In such a case, the session description <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> signal the compliance with the media type parameter TP.  The actual applied traffic shaping and timing delivery mechanism is outside the scope of this memo and does not influence the payload packetization.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="congestion-control-considerations"><name>Congestion Control Considerations</name>

<t>Congestion control for RTP <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be used in accordance with <xref target="RFC3550"/> and with any applicable RTP profile, e.g., RTP/AVP <xref target="RFC3551"/> or RTP/AVPF <xref target="RFC4585"/>.</t>

<t>While JPEG XS is mainly designed to be used in controlled network environments, it can also be employed in best-effort network environments, like the Internet. However, in this case, the users of this payload format <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> monitor packet loss to ensure that the packet loss rate is within acceptable parameters. This can be achieved, for example, by means of RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Feedback for Congestion Control <xref target="RFC8888"/>.</t>

<t>In addition, <xref target="RFC8083"/> is an update to <xref target="RFC3550"/> that defines criteria for when one is required to stop sending RTP Packet Streams and for when applications implementing this standard <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> comply with it.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC8085"/> provides additional information on the best practices for applying congestion control to UDP streams.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="sec-payload-params"><name>Payload Format Parameters</name>

<t>This section specifies the required and optional parameters of the payload format and/or the RTP stream. All parameters are declarative, meaning that the information signaled by the parameters is also present in the payload data, namely in the payload header (see <xref target="sec_payload_header_usage"/>) or in the JPEG XS header segment. When provided, their respective values <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be consistent with the payload.</t>

<section anchor="sec-media-type-reg"><name>Media Type Registration</name>

<t>This registration is done using the template defined in <xref target="RFC6838"/> and following <xref target="RFC4855"/>.</t>

<section anchor="sdp-parameters"><name>SDP Parameters</name>

<t>A mapping of the parameters into the Session Description Protocol (SDP) <xref target="RFC8866"/> is provided for applications that use SDP.</t>

<section anchor="mapping-of-payload-type-parameters-to-sdp"><name>Mapping of Payload Type Parameters to SDP</name>

<t>The media type video/jxsv string is mapped to fields in the Session Description Protocol (SDP) <xref target="RFC8866"/> as follows:</t>

<t>The media type ("video") goes in SDP "m=" as the media name.</t>

<t>The media subtype ("jxsv") goes in SDP "a=rtpmap" as the encoding name, followed by a slash ("/") and the required parameter "rate" corresponding to the RTP timestamp clock rate (which for the payload format defined in this document <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be 90000).</t>

<t>The required parameter "packetmode" and any of the additional optional parameters, as described in <xref target="sec-media-type-reg"/>, go in the SDP media format description, being the "a=fmtp" attribute (Format Parameters), by copying them directly from the media type string as a semicolon-separated list of parameter=value pairs.</t>

<t>All parameters of the media format <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> correspond to the parameters of the payload. In case of discrepancies between payload parameter values and SDP fields, the values from the payload data <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> prevail.</t>

<t>The receiver <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> ignore any parameter that is not defined in <xref target="sec-media-type-reg"/>.</t>

<t>An example SDP mapping for JPEG XS video is as follows:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
m=video 30000 RTP/AVP 112
a=rtpmap:112 jxsv/90000
a=fmtp:112 packetmode=0;sampling=YCbCr-4:2:2;
            width=1920;height=1080;depth=10;
            colorimetry=BT709;TCS=SDR;RANGE=FULL;TP=2110TPNL
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>In this example, a JPEG XS RTP stream is to be sent to UDP destination port 30000, with an RTP dynamic payload type of 112 and a media clock rate of 90000 Hz. Note that the "a=fmtp:" line has been wrapped to fit this page and will be a single long line in the SDP file. This example includes the TP parameter (as specified in <xref target="sec-traffic-shaping"/>).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="usage-with-sdp-offeranswer-model"><name>Usage with SDP Offer/Answer Model</name>

<t>When JPEG XS is offered over RTP using SDP in an offer/answer model <xref target="RFC3264"/> for negotiation for unicast usage, the following limitations and rules apply:</t>

<t>The "a=fmtp" attribute <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be present specifying the required parameter "packetmode" and <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> specify any of the optional parameters, as described in <xref target="sec-media-type-reg"/>.</t>

<t>All parameters in the "a=fmtp" attribute indicate sending capabilities (i.e., properties of the payload).</t>

<t>An answerer of the SDP is required to support all parameters and values of the parameters provided by the offerer; otherwise, the answerer <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> reject the session. It falls on the offerer to use values that are expected to be supported by the answerer. If the answerer accepts the session, it <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> reply with the exact same
  parameter values in the "a=fmtp" attribute as they were initially offered.</t>

<t>The same RTP payload type number used in the offer <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be used in the answer, as specified in <xref target="RFC3264"/>.</t>

<t>Because this document obsoletes <xref target="RFC9134"/>, IANA is asked to change all registration information that references <xref target="RFC9134"/> to instead reference &SELF;. IANA is asked to update the media type registration "video/jxsv" as specified in <xref target="sec-media-type-reg"/> (see https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="security-considerations"><name>Security Considerations</name>

<t>RTP packets using the payload format defined in this memo are subject to the security considerations discussed in <xref target="RFC3550"/> and in any applicable RTP profile such as RTP/AVP <xref target="RFC3551"/>, RTP/AVPF <xref target="RFC4585"/>, RTP/SAVP <xref target="RFC3711"/>, or RTP/SAVPF <xref target="RFC5124"/>. This implies that confidentiality of the media streams is achieved by encryption.</t>

<t>However, as "Securing the RTP Framework: Why RTP Does Not Mandate a Single Media Security Solution" <xref target="RFC7202"/> discusses, it is not an RTP payload format's responsibility to discuss or mandate what solutions are used to meet the basic security goals like confidentiality, integrity, and source authenticity for RTP in general. This responsibility lies on anyone using RTP in an application. They can find guidance on available security mechanisms and important considerations in "Options for Securing RTP Sessions" <xref target="RFC7201"/>. Applications <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> use one or more appropriate strong security
mechanisms.</t>

<t>Implementations of this RTP payload format need to take appropriate security considerations into account. It is important for the decoder to be robust against malicious or malformed payloads and ensure that they do not cause the decoder to overrun its allocated memory or otherwise misbehave. An overrun in allocated memory could lead to arbitrary code execution by an attacker. The same applies to the encoder, even though problems in encoders are typically rarer.</t>

<t>This payload format and the JPEG XS encoding do not exhibit any substantial non-uniformity, either in output or in complexity to perform the decoding operation; thus, they are unlikely to pose a denial-of-service threat due to the receipt of pathological datagrams.</t>

<t>This payload format and the JPEG XS encoding do not contain code that is executable.</t>

<t>It is important to note that high-definition (HD) or ultra-high-definition (UHD) video that is encoded with JPEG XS can have significant bandwidth requirements (typically more than 1 Gbps for UHD video, especially if using high framerate). This is sufficient to cause potential for denial of service if transmitted onto most currently available Internet paths.</t>

<t>Accordingly, if best-effort service is being used, users of this payload format <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> monitor packet loss to ensure that the packet loss rate is within acceptable parameters. Packet loss is considered acceptable if a TCP flow across the same network path, and experiencing the same network conditions, would achieve an average throughput, measured on a reasonable timescale, that is not less than the RTP flow is achieving. This condition can be satisfied by implementing congestion control mechanisms to adapt the transmission rate (or the number of layers subscribed for a layered multicast session) or by arranging for a receiver to leave the session if the loss rate is unacceptably high.</t>

<t>This payload format may also be used in networks that provide quality-of-service guarantees. If enhanced service is being used, receivers <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> monitor packet loss to ensure that the service that was requested is actually being delivered. If it is not, then they <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> assume that they are receiving best-effort service and behave accordingly.</t>

    <abstract>
      <t>This memorandum describes RTP, the real-time transport protocol. RTP provides end-to-end network transport functions suitable for applications transmitting real-time data, such as audio, video or simulation data, over multicast or unicast network services. RTP does not address resource reservation and does not guarantee quality-of- service for real-time services. The data transport is augmented by a control protocol (RTCP) to allow monitoring of the data delivery in a manner scalable to large multicast networks, and to provide minimal control and identification functionality. RTP and RTCP are designed to be independent of the underlying transport and network layers. The protocol supports the use of RTP-level translators and mixers. Most of the text in this memorandum is identical to RFC 1889 which it obsoletes. There are no changes in the packet formats on the wire, only changes to the rules and algorithms governing how the protocol is used. The biggest change is an enhancement to the scalable timer algorithm for calculating when to send RTCP packets in order to minimize transmission in excess of the intended rate when many participants join a session simultaneously.

      <t>This document describes a profile called "RTP/AVP" for the use of the real-time transport protocol (RTP), version 2, and the associated control protocol, RTCP, within audio and video multiparticipant conferences with minimal control. It provides interpretations of generic fields within the RTP specification suitable for audio and video conferences. In particular, this document defines a set of default mappings from payload type numbers to encodings. This document also describes how audio and video data may be carried within RTP. It defines a set of standard encodings and their names when used within RTP. The descriptions provide pointers to reference implementations and the detailed standards. This document is meant as an aid for implementors of audio, video and other real-time multimedia applications. This memorandum obsoletes RFC 1890. It is mostly backwards-compatible except for functions removed because two interoperable implementations were not found. The additions to RFC 1890 codify existing practice in the use of payload formats under this profile and include new payload formats defined since RFC 1890 was published. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

    <title>Multimedia Congestion Control: Circuit Breakers for Unicast RTP Sessions</title>

    <date month="March" year="2017"/>
    <abstract>
      <t>The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is widely used in telephony, video conferencing, and telepresence applications. Such applications are often run on best-effort UDP/IP networks. If congestion control is not implemented in these applications, then network congestion can lead to uncontrolled packet loss and a resulting deterioration of the user's multimedia experience. The congestion control algorithm acts as a safety measure by stopping RTP flows from using excessive resources and protecting the network from overload. At the time of this writing, however, while there are several proprietary solutions, there is no standard algorithm for congestion control of interactive RTP flows.</t>
      <t>This document does not propose a congestion control algorithm. It instead defines a minimal set of RTP circuit breakers: conditions under which an RTP sender needs to stop transmitting media data to protect the network from excessive congestion. It is expected that, in the absence of long-lived excessive congestion, RTP applications running on best-effort IP networks will be able to operate without triggering these circuit breakers. To avoid triggering the RTP circuit breaker, any Standards Track congestion control algorithms defined for RTP will need to operate within the envelope set by these RTP circuit breaker algorithms.</t>

      <t>The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) provides a minimal message-passing transport that has no inherent congestion control mechanisms. This document provides guidelines on the use of UDP for the designers of applications, tunnels, and other protocols that use UDP. Congestion control guidelines are a primary focus, but the document also provides guidance on other topics, including message sizes, reliability, checksums, middlebox traversal, the use of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN), Differentiated Services Code Points (DSCPs), and ports.</t>
      <t>Because congestion control is critical to the stable operation of the Internet, applications and other protocols that choose to use UDP as an Internet transport must employ mechanisms to prevent congestion collapse and to establish some degree of fairness with concurrent traffic. They may also need to implement additional mechanisms, depending on how they use UDP.</t>

      <t>Real-time media streams that use RTP are, to some degree, resilient against packet losses. Receivers may use the base mechanisms of the Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP) to report packet reception statistics and thus allow a sender to adapt its transmission behavior in the mid-term. This is the sole means for feedback and feedback-based error repair (besides a few codec-specific mechanisms). This document defines an extension to the Audio-visual Profile (AVP) that enables receivers to provide, statistically, more immediate feedback to the senders and thus allows for short-term adaptation and efficient feedback-based repair mechanisms to be implemented. This early feedback profile (AVPF) maintains the AVP bandwidth constraints for RTCP and preserves scalability to large groups. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

    <abstract>
      <t>The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is used in a large number of different application domains and environments. This heterogeneity implies that different security mechanisms are needed to provide services such as confidentiality, integrity, and source authentication of RTP and RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) packets suitable for the various environments. The range of solutions makes it difficult for RTP-based application developers to pick the most suitable mechanism. This document provides an overview of a number of security solutions for RTP and gives guidance for developers on how to choose the appropriate security mechanism.</t>

    <author fullname="M. Westerlund" initials="M." surname="Westerlund"/>
    <date month="April" year="2014"/>
    <abstract>
      <t>This memo discusses the problem of securing real-time multimedia sessions. It also explains why the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) and the associated RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) do not mandate a single media security mechanism. This is relevant for designers and reviewers of future RTP extensions to ensure that appropriate security mechanisms are mandated and that any such mechanisms are specified in a manner that conforms with the RTP architecture.</t>

    <abstract>
      <t>An effective RTP congestion control algorithm requires more fine-grained feedback on packet loss, timing, and Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) marks than is provided by the standard RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Sender Report (SR) and Receiver Report (RR) packets. This document describes an RTCP feedback message intended to enable congestion control for interactive real-time traffic using RTP. The feedback message is designed for use with a sender-based congestion control algorithm, in which the receiver of an RTP flow sends back to the sender RTCP feedback packets containing the information the sender needs to perform congestion control.</t>

      <t>This document specifies a Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) payload format to be used for transporting video encoded with JPEG XS (ISO/IEC 21122). JPEG XS is a low-latency, lightweight image coding system. Compared to an uncompressed video use case, it allows higher resolutions and video frame rates while offering visually lossless quality, reduced power consumption, and encoding-decoding latency confined to a fraction of a video frame.</t>

<section anchor="annex-a"><name>Changes from RFC9134</name>

<t>Most of this RFC is identical to <xref target="RFC9134"/>. There are no changes in the packet formatting or headers defined by this RTP payload specification, only new provisions are added to support the features that were added by the third edition of <xref target="ISO21122-1"/>, <xref target="ISO21122-2"/>, and <xref target="ISO21122-3"/>, in particular the new Temporal Differential Coding (TDC) profile. The revised payload format is designed to ensure that existing compliant implementations of <xref target="RFC9134"/> remain valid under the updated specification. Additionally, this document consolidates the errata of <xref target="RFC9134"/> and includes improvements and clarifications to enhance its clarity and effectiveness.</t>

<t>A summary of the changes:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>For TDC profiles, <xref target="ISO21122-1"/> relies on a specific slice header marker called SLI, in addition to the original SLH marker. The SLI marker indicates that the slice encodes TDC-enabled content. This distinction is not directly relevant to this specification, and for the purposes of this RFC, both the SLH and SLI markers serve the same function: to define the boundaries of packetization units when using the Slice Packetization mode, as described in <xref target="sec_rtp_packetization"/>. Yet, this document was updated to reflect the possibility for using either SLH and SLI markers.</t>
  <t>In addition to the level and sublevel, the TDC coding mode introduces an fbblevel in <xref target="ISO21122-2"/> that needs to be supported as an optional payload parameter. A new parameter for signaling the fbblevel is defined in <xref target="sec-payload-params"/>.</t>
  <t>This document now provides more clarifications and improved descriptions for correctly handling interlaced video.</t>
  <t><xref target="sec-codestream"/> provides a more detailed definition of a Slice to clarify that this RTP payload format supports the optional slice-based extension marker functionality defined in <xref target="ISO21122-1"/>.</t>
  <t>The erratum of <xref target="RFC9134"/> concerning the RTP timestamp for interlaced video signals has been incorporated into this specification.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section numbered="false" anchor="Acknowledgements"><name>Acknowledgements</name>

<t>This document is a revision of <xref target="RFC9134"/>. As such the authors would like to thank the following people for their valuable contributions that made <xref target="RFC9134"/> and this document possible: Siegfried Foessel, Arnaud Germain, Jean-Baptiste Lorent, Sébastien Lugan, Gaël Rouvroy, and Alexandre Willème.</t>
